        <h2>Highlights</h2>
        <p>In 1184 BC, King Agamemnon unites the Greek kingdoms. Achilles, a heroic warrior, fights for Agamemnon but despises his tyrannical rule. Meanwhile, Prince Hector of Troy and his brother Paris negotiate a peace treaty with Menelaus, King of Sparta. Paris begins an affair with Menelaus' wife, Queen Helen, and he smuggles her aboard his home-bound vessel. Angered, Menelaus meets Agamemnon, his elder brother, and asks him to help take Troy. Agamemnon agrees, as conquering Troy would give him control of the Aegean Sea. Agamemnon sends Odysseus, King of Ithaca, to persuade Achilles to join them. Initially reluctant, Achillesâ€™ seeks out his mother Thetis who tells him that if he goes to Troy, he will achieve eternal glory, but he will never return home. However, if he stays, he will live a long life, but his name will be forgotten.</p>
